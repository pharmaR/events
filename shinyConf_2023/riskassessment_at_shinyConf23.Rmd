## Abstract

Building an analysis pipeline can be hard. Especially when it relies on seemingly obscure packages that perform much-needed tasks. Without re-inventing the wheel or painstakingly browsing the source code, how can a programmer get a high-level overview of an R package’s integrity or trustworthiness? After all, the last thing anyone wants is to adopt a package that later pushes unannounced breaking changes, or worse – was written by an un-responsive author who has abandoned their code.

Enter the `{riskassessment}` app, an open-source front-end to the `{riskmetric}` package. `{riskmetric}` provides a framework to quantify risk via metrics that evaluate package dev best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and sustainability. The app aims to be a platform for quality assessment within organizations that operate in regulated industries but can be leveraged in various contexts. This presentation will teach you how to leverage `{riskassessment}` to evaluate your R package line up and discuss where development is heading in the future.
