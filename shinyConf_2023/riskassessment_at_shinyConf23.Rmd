# `{riskassessment}` app @ shinyConf 2023 <a href='https://bit.ly/raa_docs'><img src="figures/hex-riskassessment-aspconfig.png" align="right" height="172" style="float:right; height:172px;"/></a>

March 15 - 17, Appsilon hosted the [2nd Annual Shiny Conference](https://shinyconf.appsilon.com/) which was fully virtual with approximately 4k registrants. The conference also had a dedicated [slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T04PB2RNVGE/C04PB2RQBUN) for questions and communication (outside of the hopin platform).

Aaron Clark, from the R Validation Hub Executive Committee, submitted the following abstract along with the `{riskassessment}` application work, featured in the "Shiny Showcase". His talk was available on demand through all three days of the conference and was voted "favorite Shiny App" by conference attendees.

## Abstract

Building an analysis pipeline can be hard. Especially when it relies on seemingly obscure packages that perform much-needed tasks. Without re-inventing the wheel or painstakingly browsing the source code, how can a programmer get a high-level overview of an R package’s integrity or trustworthiness? After all, the last thing anyone wants is to adopt a package that later pushes unannounced breaking changes, or worse – was written by an un-responsive author who has abandoned their code.

Enter the `{riskassessment}` app, an open-source front-end to the `{riskmetric}` package. `{riskmetric}` provides a framework to quantify risk via metrics that evaluate package dev best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and sustainability. The app aims to be a platform for quality assessment within organizations that operate in regulated industries but can be leveraged in various contexts. This presentation will teach you how to leverage `{riskassessment}` to evaluate your R package line up and discuss where development is heading in the future.

## Presentation

The talk is currently available on [Appsilon's youtube channel](https://bit.ly/raa_shinyconf23). The first half provides a high level overview that introduces the audience to the work and the second half gives a hands-on demo:
