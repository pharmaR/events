Authors: Juliane Manitz, Antal Martinecz and Doug Kelkhoff on behalf of the R Validation Hub

This contribution reflects on framework and tools by the R Validation Hub for risk-based assessment of R packages within a validated infrastructure. 
The R Validation Hub is a cross-industry initiative funded by the R Consortium, that to supports the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting. 
We will discuss the framework for the risk-based assessment of R packages, that has been utilized by key pharma companies across the industry. 
We also showcase the {riskmetric} R package, that evaluates the risk of an R package using a specified set of metrics and validation criteria, and 
the {riskassessment} app, that augments the utility of the {riskmetric} package within a Shiny app front end. 
Lastly, we will outline a prototype of a technical framework for a 'repository' of R packages with accompanying evidence of their quality and the assessment criteria. 
Although, our work has mostly focused in biopharmaceutical, it may also be relevant in other regulated areas such as financial service industries and agriculture.
