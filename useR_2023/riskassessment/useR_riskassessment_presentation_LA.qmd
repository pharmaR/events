## Validating open-source software

-   Consortia of ~50 companies (mostly pharma and biotech)
-   Focus on designing/building a framework to validate R and R packages with an eye to all open-source software.
-   pharmar.org to learn about all workstreams and to get involved!
-   The main goal is ensuring proper validation documentation exists in accordance with expectations of regulatory agencies.

## Two tools

## What do they do?

::: columns

::: {.column width="80%"}
is a framework to quantify an R package’s “risk”
… by assessing several meaningful metrics designed to evaluate package development best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and development sustainability. <br><br>
is a full-fledged R package containing a shiny front-end
… that augments the utility of {riskmetric}. The application's goal is to provide a central hub for an organization to review and assess the risk of R packages, providing handy tools and guide rails along the way.

## Software quality mitigates potential risks

::: {.column width="80%" .quarto-subcolumn style="font-size: 24px;"} 
Sometimes “quality” is measurable! Software dev best practices dictate an R-package should have:<br>

-   A license
-   Source code available for browsing
-   An easy to contact maintainer
-   Up-to-date news regarding new features and bugs
-   A place to report bugs
-   Evidence that new bugs are being addressed
-   Package documentation & user guides/ perhaps a website
-   Complete Function documentation
-   Adequate test coverage
-   Community usage
-   Many more!

## Why create a Shiny app?

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/riskassessment_logo.png)
:::

::: {.column width="80%" .quarto-subcolumn style="font-size: 20px;"}
The app extends the functionality of {riskmetric} by managing the review process <b>within an organizational context</b>, empowering the reviewer to:
<br>

-   Analyze {riskmetric} output without the need to write R code
-   Run {riskmetric} on the same machine with the same environment – creating central hub for reproducibility of risk scores
-   Facilitate and store communication on certain packages / metrics
-   Automatically categorize a package with an overall decision (i.e., low, medium, or high risk) based on {riskmetric} scores
-   Or take a more hands-on approach categorizing packages using subjective opinions from yourself or consensus from other users
-   Generate reports with the risk score, metrics outputs, reviewer comments, and more
-   Log assessments in a database for future viewing or historical backup
-   Leverage user authentication with admin roles to manage users and tasks like org-level metric weighting
