is a framework to quantify an R package's "risk" by assessing several meaningful metrics designed to evaluate package development best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and development sustainability.<br><br><br> is a full-fledged R package containing a shiny front-end that augments the utility of `{riskmetric}`. The application's goal is to provide a central hub for an organization to review and assess the risk of R packages, providing handy tools and guide rails along the way.

::: {.column width="80%"}
<!-- Sometimes "quality" is measurable! Software dev best practices dictate an R-package should have:<br> -->

::: {style="font-size:28px"}
-   A license
-   Source code available for browsing
-   An easy to contact maintainer
-   A place to report bugs
-   Evidence that new bugs are being addressed
-   Complete Function documentation
-   Adequate test coverage
-   Community usage
-   18 total assessments (to date)!

## Why create a Shiny app?

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}

::: {.column width="80%"}
<!-- The app extends the functionality of {riskmetric} by managing the review process <b>within an organizational context</b>, empowering the reviewer to: <br> -->

::: {style="font-size:28px"}
-   Analyze `{riskmetric}` output without the need to write R code
-   Run `{riskmetric}` on the same machine with the same environment -- creating central hub for reproducibility of risk scores
-   Facilitate and store communication on certain packages / metrics
-   Automatic package categorization with an overall decision based on `{riskmetric}` scores
-   Generate dynamic reports
-   Leverage user authentication with user role management

## Coming soon

#### {riskscore}

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%" style="font-size:28px"}
In it's early stages, a new data package containing the `{riskmetric}` assessments & scores for all packages on CRAN.

## Coming soon

#### Package Explorer

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%" style="font-size:28px"}
A suite of hands-on review tools (from our friends at GSK) will allow users to browse unit tests, source code, and man (doc) pages for any exported function.
