-   Consortia of \~50 companies (mostly pharma and biotech)
-   <b>Mission:</b> R Validation Hub is a cross-industry initiative whose
mission is to enable the use of R by the Bio-Pharmaceutical
industry in a regulatory setting, where the output may be
used in submissions to regulatory agencies.

is a framework to quantify an R package's "risk" by assessing several meaningful metrics designed to evaluate package development best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and development sustainability. <br><br> is a full-fledged R package containing a shiny front-end that augments the utility of `riskmetric`. The application's goal is to provide a central hub for an organization to review and assess the risk of R packages, providing handy tools and guide rails along the way.

<!-- Sometimes "quality" is measurable! Software dev best practices dictate an R-package should have:<br> -->

-   A license
-   Source code available for browsing
-   An easy to contact maintainer
-   A place to report bugs
-   Evidence that new bugs are being addressed
-   Complete Function documentation
-   Adequate test coverage
-   Community usage
-   Many more!

## Why create a Shiny app?

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}

:::

::: {.column .quarto-subcolumn width="80%" style="font-size: 30px;"}
<!-- The app extends the functionality of {riskmetric} by managing the review process <b>within an organizational context</b>, empowering the reviewer to: <br> -->

-   Analyze `riskmetric` output without the need to write R code
-   Run `riskmetric` on the same machine with the same environment -- creating central hub for reproducibility of risk scores
-   Facilitate and store communication on certain packages / metrics
-   Automatic package categorization with an overall decision based on `riskmetric` scores
-   Generate dynamic reports
-   Leverage user authentication with user role management

## Coming soon

-   riskscore

in it's early stages, a new data package the R Validation Hub is working on, that contains the `riskmetric` scores for all pkgs on CRAN.

-   Package Explorer

include GSK's code to manually navigate the actual package contents (e.g. browse the robustness of tests written for each function).
