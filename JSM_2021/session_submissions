Title:	Tools to enable the use of R by the bio-pharmaceutical industry in a regulatory setting

Session Description:	This topic-contributed session aims to discuss different initiatives to support R-based submissions in a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting. In particular, the following topics will be addressed:
- Risk-based assessment of R package accuracy
- Considerations for testing of R packages
- Standard formatting for submission-ready tables
Statistical analysis software used for new drug applications in the biopharmaceutical regulatory setting has to fulfill specific requirements. Special attention given to the validation of the software. The food and drug administration (FDA) provides a clear definition of validation (see Glossary of Computer System Software Development Terminology), which can be broken down into three core components: accuracy, reproducibility, and traceability.
Having these three components in mind, we present ideas and suggestions reflecting the current thinking of the R Validation Hub working group and collaboration partners, which is a cross-industry initiative funded by the R Consortium. Our mission is the support the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting. A comprehensive framework is discussed in a white paper (see A risk-based approach for assessing R package accuracy within a validated infrastructure).
Although the SAS programming language is the current standard, the FDA does not require use of any specific software for statistical analyses. R is among the most widely used statistical software in the industry and academia. As an open-source software, it benefits from contributed packages developed and tested by scientists, statistical programmers, and the R community in general.
For the risk assessment, we differentiate two types of R packages: 1) Core and recommended packages that are shipped with the basic installation and a rigorous software development lifecycle assures minimal risk, and 2) Contributed packages that may vary in their accuracy and development rigor, which could be assessed by various metrics. We focus our attention on validating contributed packages. We present some of the tools that provide workflow to evaluate the quality of a set of R packages: The R package riskmetric, an associated shiny application to perform risk assessments, and discuss things to consider when testing R packages. Lastly, we offer some insights into standard tables for submissions and the r2rtf package.
