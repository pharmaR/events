## 🗒️ Meeting Notes

**Slide Deck Content**

Questions to consider when thinking about open-source contribution

-   **What do you think may be an obstacle in engaging with open-source technologies?**

-   **Do you find it difficult to separate your engagement as an individual R user from your engagement as a member of a broader company?**

-   **If you work at a company that is starting to use open-source languages, do you feel a conflict in the way you engage with open-source?**

-   **Unwritten rules/etiquette/responsibilities of users and developers, for example regarding feedback or contributions**

**Large Group Discussion**

-   Attendees were distributed pretty equally across users, developers, and administrators in regard to open-source, and most had been accustomed to providing comments/feedback about bugs to developers

-   Etiquette that everyone contribute for the greater good (ex: develop, report bugs/issues, etc.)

-   School/University versus workplace confidence

    -   Risk of projects affecting your use of open-source and opting for approaches like base R instead

-   Discussions about companies' encouragement or discouragement (even to a legal degree) for open-source involvement

    -   Some encouraging if the open-source contribution benefits the company's work (ex: clinical trial filing and contributing to admiral/pharmaverse)

    -   Some restrictive to only submitting issues without any hint of what work is being done internally

    -   Legal often involved for making something that is originally internal into open-source

-   Representing yourself and/or company with open-source involvement

    -   Reflective of your capabilities (ex: admitting to not knowing linear regression models well on personal account circling back to company)

    -   General reluctance or hesitancy

-   Guidelines to make people more comfortable for involvement in open-source would be helpful

**Other**

-   Be on the lookout for our updated website going live

-   Community meetings happen quarterly (every three months) on the third Tuesday of the month
