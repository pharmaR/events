## Two tools: what do they do

is a framework to quantify an R package's "risk" by assessing several meaningful metrics designed to evaluate package development best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and development sustainability.<br><br><br> is a full-fledged R package containing a shiny front-end that augments the utility of `{riskmetric}`. The application's goal is to provide a central hub for an organization to review and assess the risk of R packages, providing handy tools and guide rails along the way.

## Two tools: where they fit



## Quantify risk programmatically

Sometimes "quality" is measurable! Software dev best practices dictate an R-package should have:<br>

-   A license
-   Source code available for browsing
-   An easy to contact maintainer
-   A place to report bugs
-   Evidence that new bugs are being addressed
-   Complete Function documentation
-   Adequate test coverage
-   Community usage

18 total assessments (to date)!

## Why create a Shiny app?

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/riskassessment_logo.png)
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
<!-- The app extends the functionality of {riskmetric} by managing the review process <b>within an organizational context</b>, empowering the reviewer to: <br> -->

::: {style="font-size:28px"}
Our audience / users: those those making 'package inclusion' requests for GxP environments. They need support to...

-  Generate consistent, org-specific analysis of risk outputs & a means for package exploration without the need to write R code
-  Run `{riskmetric}` on the same machine with the same environment -- creating a central hub for reproducibility
-  Automate 'decision triage' based on pre-defined rules, saving time & mental energy
-  Manage who's involved in the review process with user authentication with user role management
-  Facilitate and store communication between many users, on certain packages and/or metrics
-  Generate risk summary reports, with opportunity to inject opinions, for sharing with the decision making parties
