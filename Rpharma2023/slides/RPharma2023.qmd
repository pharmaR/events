-   The FDA appears to accept `.R` files through their eSUB portal[^1] .
-   The FDA has released a draft of a new *Computer Software Assurance*[^2] guideline that seems to be increasingly the basis for their evaluation of R.

-   A cross-industry group formed of members from PHUSE, PSI, and ASA.
-   Released a [white paper](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Data+Visualisation+%26+Open+Source+Technology/WP077.pdf) providing guidance on appropriate use of stats methods, e.g.

    -   Don't default to the defaults
    -   Be specific when drafting analysis plans, including precise methods & options

-   Currently building a repository of methods comparisons at [psiaims.github.io/CAMIS](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/).

# üìú Workstream Report


## [Case Studies](https://www.pharmar.org/casestudies/)

> 7 Companies Shared their Approach to Package Validation

::: {.columns style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Commonalities

-   Categorized risk (hi/med/lo)
-   Heavily weight unit testing
-   Base & recommended packages "trusted"
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Differences

-   Risk stratification, e.g, coverage cutoff

-   Managing risk

    -   human-in-the-middle review
    -   restricted package subset
    -   adding bespoke testing
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Themes

-   Time & resource intensive
-   Requires unique intersection of expertise
-   **Challenges of lifecycle management of ecosystem**

## ![](assets/riskmetric.png){height="1.8em" width="1.8em" style="margin: 0 0.2em; object-fit: contain;vertical-align: middle;"} `{riskmetric}` Roadmap

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   **Ease of use:**\
    Wrapper functions for a complete workflow, prettier outputs
-   **Metric completeness:**\
    Implement metrics for as many package sources as possible. Chain sources together to create more complete assessments
-   **Modular addititions:**\
    Allow users to easy add custom assessments, create optional assessments based on community packages, e.g. `oysteR`, `srr`, `pkgstats`
-   **Focusing on metrics and scoring:**\
    Making custom weighting more robust and convenient. Guidance materials on weighting specific assessments based on community feedback and our own views on best practices.

> ‚ÄúBest App‚Äù Award at Shiny Conf 2023

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}


-   **Face lifts:** \
    Improved *Report Builder* & *Database View*. Better dependency inspection

-   **Admin tools:**\
    Org-level customization using `config` file. Allow `admin` user role management

-   **Source file explorer** (original code provided by *GSK*):\
    Allows to browse test files with brand-new add-on to browse help and source code of a function in the same module

-   **Automatic risk sssessment:**\
    Write custom code to automatically categorize packages into low/medium/high risk

# üì¶ Repositories

## Repositories Workstream

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
> Supporting a transparent, open, dynamic, cross-industry approach of establishing and maintaining a *repository* of R packages.

-   Taking ample time to engage stakeholders

    -   Validation leads across the industry
    -   Active health authority involvement
    -   Analytic environment admins and developers

-   Considering the possibilities

    -   Mapping needs to solutions that meet the industry where it is
    -   ...while building the path for it to move forward
:::

## How did we get here?

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   [Our whitepaper is widely adopted]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}

-   [But implementing it is inconsistent & laborious]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}

    -   [Variations throughout industry pose uncertainty]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
    -   [Sharing software with health authorities is a challenge]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
    -   [Health authorities, overwhelmed by technical inconsistencies, are more likely to question software use]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}

-   We feel the most productive path forward is a shared ecosystem
:::

::: notes
-   **inconsistent**: Vendored choices inevitably face inconsistency when merged with internally developed tools
-   **sharing**: `pkglite`, `.R` files now permitted, Hosting on git repo/r-universe? But comes with extra install steps.
-   **laborious**: We're all reviewing the same tools, duplicating effort and

**Building consensus in package evaluation and distribution...**

0.  Who needs a repository anyways?
1.  Stakeholder engagement [3mo]{.dim}\
2.  Product refinement and proof-of-concept planning [1mo]{.dim}
3.  POC development [2mo]{.dim}


## What does a solution look like? {visibility="hidden"}

::: callout-note
## If it's not broke, don't fix it!
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   R has this wonderful thing called CRAN, setting the standard of quality

    -   Packages are constantly tested together
    -   R has a culture of amazing documentation
    -   Statisticians flock to R, and are constantly vetting its implementations

## What does a solution look like? {visibility="hidden"}

::: callout-warning
## Fool me twice, shame on me
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   R has this thorn in its side called CRAN,

    -   Builds are difficult to reproduce (key for validation)
    -   Quality indicators are lacking
    -   Difficult to roll back to an older snapshot (although tools exist to help with this.)
    -   Governance isn't always the most friendly

## What does a solution look like?

::: callout-tip
## Closing the CRAN gap for the Pharma Use Case
:::

-   Reproducibility guidelines
-   Standard, public assessment of packages
-   Avenues for communicating about implementations, bugs, security

## The Proposal so Far

-   [***A "Golden" Base Image***]{.highlight}\
    to establish ground truth for testing.
-   [***Rethinking requirements***]{.highlight}\
    testing, external vetting (CRAN) and adoption are sufficient for *Scripted Testing* needs - are new requirements necessary?\
-   [***Expectations of Public Communication***]{.highlight}\
    industry-standard communication channels.
-   [***Nearly all meaningful assessment can be automated***]{.highlight}\
    edge cases (malicious code, methods debate) are better handled by transparent community engagement.
