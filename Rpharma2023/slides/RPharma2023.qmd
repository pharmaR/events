-   The FDA appears to accept `.R` files through their eSUB portal[^1] .
-   The FDA has released a draft of a new *Computer Software
    Assurance*[^2] guideline that seems to be increasingly the basis for
    their evaluation of R.

- Released a [white paper](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Data+Visualisation+%26+Open+Source+Technology/WP077.pdf) providing guidance on appropriate use of stats methods, for example: 
   * Don't default to the defaults
   * Be specific when drafting analysis plans, including precise methods & options 
- Currently building a repository of methods comparisons at

# üìú Workstream Report

> 7 Companies Shared their Approach to Package Validation

::: {.columns style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Commonalities

-   Categorized risk (hi/med/lo)
-   Heavily weight unit testing
-   Base & Suggested packages "trusted"
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Differences

-   Risk stratification (eg coverage cutoff)
-   Managing risk
    -   human-in-the-middle review
    -   restricted package subset
    -   adding bespoke testing
:::

#### Themes

-   Time & resource intensive
-   Requires unique intersection of expertise
-   **Challenges of lifecycle management of ecosystem**

## ![](assets/riskmetric.png){height="1.8em" width="1.8em" style="margin: 0 0.2em; object-fit: contain;vertical-align: middle;"} `{riskmetric}` Roadmap

::: {style="font-size:0.8em"}
-   **Ease of use:**\
    Wrapper functions for a a complete workflow, prettier outputs
-   **Metric completeness:**\
    Implement metrics for as many pacakge sources as possible. Chain
    sources together to create more complete assessments
-   **Modular addititions:**\
    Allow users to easy add custom assessments, create optional
    assessments based on community packages (e.g. `oyster`, `srr`,
    `pkgstats`, etc)
-   **Focusing on metrics and scoring:**\
    Making custom weighting more robust and convenient. Guidance
    materials on weighting specific assessments based on community
    feedback and our own views on best practices.

# üì¶ Repositories

## Repositories Workstream

::: { style="font-size: 0.8em;" }
> Supporting a transparent, open, dynamic, cross-industry approach of
> establishing and maintaining a _repository_ of R packages.

* Taking ample time to engage stakeholders
  * Validation leads across the industry
  * Active health authority involvement
  * Analytic environment admins and developers
* Considering the possibilities
  * Mapping needs to solutions that meet the industry where it is
  * ...while building the path for it to move forward
:::


## How did we get here?

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
* [Our whitepaper is widely adopted]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* [But implementing it is inconsistent & laborious]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}   
  * [Variations throughout industry pose uncertainty]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Sharing software with health authorities is a challenge]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Health authorities, overwhelmed by technical inconsistencies, are more likely to question software use]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* We feel the most productive path forward is a shared ecosystem
:::

::: {.notes}
- **inconsistent**: Vendored choices inevitably face inconsistency when
  merged with internally developed tools
- **sharing**: `pkglite`, `.R` files now permitted, Hosting on git repo/r-universe? But comes with extra install steps.
- **laborious**: We're all reviewing the same tools, duplicating effort and
:::


## Work to-date

**Building consensus in package evaluation and distribution...**

0. Who needs a repository anyways?
1. Stakeholder engagement [3mo]{.dim}  
2. Product refinement and proof-of-concept planning [1mo]{.dim}
3. POC development [2mo]{.dim}


## ‚úã Hold up! Why a repository?

> "Every successful team starts with a small existential crisis"  
>  -- _unknown_

- Tools for building evaluation in-house?
- Sharing of extra testing resources?
- Curation of packages?
- A stricter CRAN?


## Interesting Stakeholder Findings

- Health authority primary concerns
  - Avoiding **security vulnerabilities** while using R
  - Visible discussions **vetting methodology** and relevance
- Industry validation leads
  - Relieved that open-source tools are public, less need to audit
    vendored tools
- System administrators, users and developers
  - Want **clarity** and **consistency** internally and externally


## Prototyping

Running three prototypes to explore specific needs

- Test case exchange format ([repo](https://github.com/kkmann/rmes/pulls))
- Communication channels for methods discussion & considerations ([google doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b9VZjVM1pzzSmrO7WFKK43EjBZMT0smRrNY_0BPSR0s/edit#slide=id.g1e4f3a104ee_0_0))
- Risk filters and transparency of known vulnerabilities ([repo](https://github.com/dgkf/rvalhub-repo-filters-mvp))

## A fork in the road

Given the key capabilities and tools to address them. How do we bundle
these solution to address industry needs?

- R has this wonderful thing called CRAN, setting the standard of quality
  - Packages are constantly tested together

## Fool me twice, shame on me

- R has this thorn in its side called CRAN, 
  - Builds are difficult to reproduce (key for validation)
  - Quality indicators are lacking
  - Difficult to roll back to an older snapshot (although tools exist to help with this.)
  - Governance isn't always the most friendly

- [***Rethinking requirements***]{.highlight}  
  testing, external vetting (CRAN) and adoption are sufficient for _Scripted 
  Testing_ needs - are new requirements necessary?  
- [***Expectations of Public Communication***]{.highlight}  
  industry-standard communication channels.
- [***Nearly all meaningful assessment can be automated***]{.highlight}  
  edge cases (malicious code, methods debate) are better handled by
