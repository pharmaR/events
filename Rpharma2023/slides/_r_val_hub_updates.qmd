## Change of Leadership

-   We thank Andy for his leadership and enthusiasm that brought the R
    Validation Hub to this point.

### Pulse Check

<!-- - We looked back on how we had been working -->

-   Identified new opportunities
    1.  Refining holistic strategic direction
    2.  Be mindful about communication and organization
-   We have a new Communication workstream! (and awesome new slides!)
-   More ways to get involved

-   Heavily weight unit testing
-   Base & Suggested packages "trusted"
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Differences

-   Risk stratification (eg coverage cutoff)
-   Managing risk
    -   human-in-the-middle review
    -   restricted package subset
    -   adding bespoke testing

::: {style="font-size:0.8em"}
-   **Ease of use:**\
    Wrapper functions for a a complete workflow, prettier outputs
-   **Metric completeness:**\
    Implement metrics for as many pacakge sources as possible. Chain
    sources together to create more complete assessments
-   **Modular addititions:**\
    Allow users to easy add custom assessments, create optional
    assessments based on community packages (e.g. `oyster`, `srr`,
    `pkgstats`, etc)
-   **Focusing on metrics and scoring:**\
    Making custom weighting more robust and convenient. Guidance
    materials on weighting specific assessments based on community
    feedback and our own views on best practices.
