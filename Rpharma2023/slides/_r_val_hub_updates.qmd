## 🗝 Key Policy Updates!

> If nothing else, take this home!

- The FDA appears to accept `.R` files through their eSUB portal[^1].
- The FDA has released a draft of a new _Computer Software Assurance[^2]_ guideline
  that seems to be increasingly the basis for their evaluation of R.

## 🗝 Key Policy Updates!

> If nothing else, take this home!

::: {.callout-tip}
## Identifying Intended Use [^2]

Software is used **directly** for the production and quality systems' 
automation inspection, testing, or the collection and processing of 
production data. Software **supports** development, monitoring and 
automated testing. _A manufacturer_ should use a **risk-based analysis
to determine appropriate assurance activities.**
:::

## 🗝 Key Policy Updates!

> If nothing else, take this home!

::: {.callout-tip}
## Determining the Appropriate Assurance Activities[^2]

Assurance can include _Ad-hoc testing_, _Exploratory testing_ (active package use), 
_Error-guessing_ (regression testing), 
_Robust scripted testing_ and _Limited scripted testing_ (traceable, reproducible testing suites).

"This approach may apply scripted testing for high-risk features"

## Change of Leadership

- We thank Andy for his leadership and enthusiasm that brought the R Validation Hub to this point.
- New R validation hub lead is Doug Kelkhoff

### Pulse Check

<!-- - We looked back on how we had been working -->
- Identified new opportunities
  1. Refining holistic strategic direction
  1. Be mindful about communication and organization
- We have a new Communication workstream! (and awesome new slides!)
- More ways to get involved

#### Commonalities

- Categorized risk (hi/med/lo)
- Heavily weight unit testing
- Base & Suggested packages "trusted"
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Differences

- Risk stratification (eg coverage cutoff)
- Managing risk
  - human-in-the-middle review 
  - restricted package subset
  - adding bespoke testing

#### Themes

- Time & resource intensive
- Requires unique intersection of expertise

::: { style="font-size:0.8em" }
- **Ease of use:**  
  Wrapper functions for a a complete workflow, prettier outputs
- **Metric completeness:**  
  Implement metrics for as many pacakge sources as possible. Chain sources 
  together to create more complete assessments
- **Modular addititions:**  
  Allow users to easy add custom assessments, create optional assessments 
  based on community packages (e.g. `oyster`, `srr`, `pkgstats`, etc)
- **Focusing on metrics and scoring:**  
  Making custom weighting more robust and convenient. Guidance materials on 
  weighting specific assessments based on community feedback and our own views 
  on best practices.

* Taking ample time to engage stakeholders
  * Validation leads across the industry
  * Active health authority involvement
  * Analytic environment admins and developers
* Considering the possibilities
  * Mapping needs to solutions that meet the industry where it is
  * ...while building the path for it to move forward
:::


## How did we get here?

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
* [Our whitepaper is widely adopted]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* [But implementing it is inconsistent & laborious]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}   
  * [Variations throughout industry pose uncertainty]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Sharing software with health authorities is a challenge]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Health authorities, overwhelmed by technical inconsistencies, are more likely to question software use]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* We feel the most productive path forward is a shared ecosystem
:::

::: {.notes}
- **inconsistent**: Vendored choices inevitably face inconsistency when
  merged with internally developed tools
- **sharing**: `pkglite`, `.R` files now permitted, Hosting on git repo/r-universe? But comes with extra install steps.
- **laborious**: We're all reviewing the same tools, duplicating effort and
:::


## Work to-date

**Building consensus in package evaluation and distribution...**

0. Who needs a repository anyways?
1. Stakeholder engagement [3mo]{.dim}  
2. Product refinement and proof-of-concept planning [1mo]{.dim}
3. POC development [2mo]{.dim}


## ✋ Hold up! Why a repository?

> "Every successful team starts with a small existential crisis"  
>  -- _unknown_

- Tools for building evaluation in-house?
- Sharing of extra testing resources?
- Curation of packages?
- A stricter CRAN?


## Embracing change

:::: {.fragment}
### Old dog, new trick

::: {.inremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
* Modern package ecosystems are the stats world's _new trick_
* Methods are provided directly by statisticians and academics, rarely by vendors.
* Risk is managed not by itemized requirements, but by good development practices.[^2]
* We need to learn how to manage risk in a constantly evolving ecosystem
:::

[^2]: [_Computer Software Assurance for Production and Quality Systems Software: Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff_](https://www.fda.gov/media/161521/download)

::: {.notes}
- **evolving**: 
  - Patches constantly fixing edge cases. Neglect to update is a risk.
  - Health authorities use latest CRAN. Differences
    in their system and yours introduces risk of inconsistency in results.

## Interesting Stakeholder Findings

- Health authority primary concerns
  - Avoiding **security vulnerabilities** while using R
  - Visible discussions **vetting methodology** and relevance
- Industry validation leads
  - Relieved that open-source tools are public, less need to audit
    vendored tools
- System administrators, users and developers
  - Want **clarity** and **consistency** internally and externally


## Prototyping

Running three prototypes to explore specific needs

- Test case exchange format ([repo](https://github.com/kkmann/rmes/pulls))
- Communication channels for methods discussion & considerations ([google doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b9VZjVM1pzzSmrO7WFKK43EjBZMT0smRrNY_0BPSR0s/edit#slide=id.g1e4f3a104ee_0_0))
