* Taking ample time to engage stakeholders
  * Validation leads across the industry
  * Active health authority involvement
  * Analytic environment admins and developers
* Considering the possibilities
  * Mapping needs to solutions that meet the industry where it is
  * ...while building the path for it to move forward

## How did we get here?

* [Our whitepaper is widely adopted]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* [But implementing it is inconsistent & laborious]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}   
  * [Variations throughout industry pose uncertainty]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Sharing software with health authorities is a challenge]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
  * [Health authorities, overwhelmed by technical inconsistencies, are more likely to question software use]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
* We feel the most productive path forward is a shared ecosystem

- **inconsistent**: Vendored choices inevitably face inconsistency when
  merged with internally developed tools
- **sharing**: `pkglite`, `.R` files now permitted, Hosting on git repo/r-universe? But comes with extra install steps.
- **laborious**: We're all reviewing the same tools, duplicating effort and

## Work to-date

**Building consensus in package evaluation and distribution...**

0. Who needs a repository anyways?
1. Stakeholder engagement [3mo]{.dim}  
2. Product refinement and proof-of-concept planning [1mo]{.dim}
3. POC development [2mo]{.dim}


## ✋ Hold up! Why a repository?

- Tools for building evaluation in-house?
- Sharing of extra testing resources?
- Curation of packages?
- A stricter CRAN?

### Old dog, new trick

::: {.inremental style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
* Modern package ecosystems are the stats world's _new trick_
* Methods are provided directly by statisticians and academics, rarely by vendors.
* Risk is managed not by itemized requirements, but by good development practices.[^2]
* We need to learn how to manage risk in a constantly evolving ecosystem

::: {.notes}
- **evolving**: 
  - Patches constantly fixing edge cases. Neglect to update is a risk.
  - Health authorities use latest CRAN. Differences
    in their system and yours introduces risk of inconsistency in results.

## Interesting Stakeholder Findings

- Health authority primary concerns
  - Avoiding **security vulnerabilities** while using R
  - Visible discussions **vetting methodology** and relevance
- Industry validation leads
  - Relieved that open-source tools are public, less need to audit
    vendored tools
- System administrators, users and developers
  - Want **clarity** and **consistency** internally and externally


## Prototyping

Running three prototypes to explore specific needs

- Test case exchange format ([repo](https://github.com/kkmann/rmes/pulls))
- Communication channels for methods discussion & considerations ([google doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b9VZjVM1pzzSmrO7WFKK43EjBZMT0smRrNY_0BPSR0s/edit#slide=id.g1e4f3a104ee_0_0))
- Risk filters and transparency of known vulnerabilities ([repo](https://github.com/dgkf/rvalhub-repo-filters-mvp))

these solution to address industry needs?
