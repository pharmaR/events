R Validation Hub is a collaboration to support the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting through appropriate tools and resourcing that leverage the open source, collaborative nature of the language. 
 
Using R in submissions to healthcare regulators is challenging since the quality of any packages used must be ensured and evidence of ensuring this quality must be made available on request. Through this presentation, we will highlight our overarching philosophy and white paper that has been used by several pharma companies, and showcase the products our working groups have developed. These include the Risk Metric framework that evaluates the risk of an R package using a specified set of metrics and validation criteria, the Risk Assessment app that augments the utility of the Risk Metric framework within a Shiny App front end, and the Repository Working Group that will be prototyping a technical framework to maintain a 'repository' of R packages with accompanying evidence of their quality and the assessment criteria. All of our work is designed to facilitate the use of R within a highly regulated space and ease the burden of using R packages within a validated environment.
