R Validation Hub is a collaboration to support the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting through appropriate tools and resourcing that leverage the open source, collaborative nature of the language. 
 
Using R in submissions to healthcare regulators requires documentation of evidence that the quality of any R packages used was assessed. Through this presentation, we will highlight a risk assessment framework for R packages that has been used by several pharma companies. We also showcase the products our working groups have developed in a cross-industry collaboration. These include the {riskmetric} R package that evaluates the risk of an R package using a specified set of metrics and validation criteria, and the {riskassessment} app that augments the utility of the {riskmetric} package within a shiny app front end. Moreover, we present a prototype a technical framework to maintain a 'repository' of R packages with accompanying evidence of their quality and the assessment criteria. All of our work is designed to facilitate the use of R within a highly regulated space and ease the burden of using R packages within a validated environment.
