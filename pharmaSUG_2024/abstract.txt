R Validation Hub is a cross-industry collaboration to support the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting through appropriate tools and resources that leverage the open source, collaborative nature of the language. 
 
Using R in submissions to healthcare regulators often requires documentation showing that the quality of the programming packages used was adequately assessed. This can pose a challenge in R where many of the commonly used tools are open source. Through this paper, we will highlight the R Validation Hub's risk assessment framework for R packages that has been utilized by key pharma companies across the industry. We also showcase the products our working groups have developed including the {riskmetric} R package that evaluates the risk of an R package using a specified set of metrics and validation criteria, and the {riskassessment} app that augments the utility of the {riskmetric} package within a Shiny app front end. Lastly, we will illustrate a prototype of a technical framework to maintain a 'repository' of R packages with accompanying evidence of their quality and the assessment criteria. All of our work is designed to facilitate the use of R within a highly regulated space and ease the burden of using R packages within a validated environment.
